\label{Conclusions}
This thesis presented a good starting point for using an unsupervised learning procedure, with the help of supervised learning, to detect ships from an aerial point of view. The EM algorithm works comparably well with both Residuals Networks and U-Net Network Architecture as shown in the Results chapter. Although, from the $F_2$ metric perspective the two solutions proposed didn't produce a large improvement over the base model, the expectation-maximization algorithm by itself, behaved well from a visual perspective, and can be used, in a practical environment, in conjunction with external help. The algorithm can be improved or even parallelized to reduce the execution time and to not give up accuracy. Since all the operation involved in the EM parameter learn and classification phase are associative, a multi-threading run can be implemented for usage of the algorithm in live instances. In this case the EM has the advantage of not needing a prior training before being put to use and is more suited for live predictions (e.g. in videos).

The EM underlying model used is relatively simple, hence it can be improved with additional work. A first idea could be the usage of multi-level EM as shown in \cite{EMObjectConcealement}, or by using a different probability function (e.g. more than two Gaussians that generated the data). The biggest challenge that these solutions faced was the color similarity between ships and ports which gives us false negatives and a lower $F_2$ score. On the other hand, when the picture were taken "at sea", the algorithm produces good results. With this in mind, the algorithm in the actual form (or eventually improved forms) can be used on datasets that match the property of having two main colors scheme inside them.
